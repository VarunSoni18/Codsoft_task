        <div class="first">Wildlife refers to undomesticated animal species, but all animals that evolve or exist in the
            wild in an environment without human introduction have come to be included. In all habitats, biodiversity
            can be found. There are distinct types of wildlife in deserts, forests, rainforests, plains, grasslands, and
            other regions, including the most populated urban areas. Although the term generally applies to animals in
            popular culture that are unaffected by human influences, most scientists accept that human activities
            influence a great deal of wildlife.

            To control the populations of different animal and bird species, forests and wildlife are importantWildlife
            provides stability to different processes of nature. Wildlife is important from an ecological perspective.
            Wildlife is an important component of the conservation of biodiversity.</div>

        <div class="second">India is home to a large variety of wildlife. It is a biodiversity hotspot with various
            ecosystems ranging from the Himalayas in the north to the evergreen rain forests in the south, the sands of
            the west to the marshy mangroves of the east. India lies within the Indomalayan realm and is the home to
            about 7.6% of mammal, 14.7% of amphibian, 6% of bird, 6.2% of reptilian, and 6.2% of flowering plant
            species.[1] India's forests contain about 500 species of mammals and more than 1300 bird species.[citation
            needed]

            India is one of the most biodiverse regions of the world and include three of the world's 36 biodiversity
            hotspots – the Western Ghats, the Eastern Himalayas, and the Indo-Burma hotspot.[2][3] It is one of the 17
            megadiverse countries. The country has 12 biosphere reserves and 75 Ramsar sites.</div>

                <p>A forest is an area of land dominated by trees. Hundreds of definitions of forest are used
                    throughout the world, incorporating factors such as tree density, tree height, land use, legal
                    standing, and ecological function. The United Nations' Food and Agriculture
                    Organization (FAO) defines a forest as, "Land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher
                    than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these
                    thresholds in situ. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban
                    use." Using this definition, Global Forest Resources Assessment 2020 (FRA 2020) found that
                    forests covered 4.06 billion hectares (10.0 billion acres; 40.6 million square kilometres; 15.7
                    million square miles), or approximately 31 percent of the world's land area in 2020.

                    Forests are the largest terrestrial ecosystem of Earth by area, and are found around the
                    globe. 45 percent of forest land is in the tropical latitudes. The next largest share of
                    forests are found in subarctic climates, followed by temperate, and subtropical zones
                    Forests form distinctly different biomes at different latitudes and elevations, and with
                    different precipitation and evapotranspiration rates.These biomes include boreal forests in
                    subarctic climates, tropical moist forests and tropical dry forests around the Equator, and
                    temperate forests at the middle latitudes. Forests form in areas of the Earth with high
                    rainfall, while drier conditions produce a transition to savanna. However, in areas with
                    intermediate rainfall levels, forest transitions to savanna rapidly when the percentage of land
                    that is covered by trees drops below 40 to 45 percent. Research conducted in the Amazon
                    rainforest shows that trees can alter rainfall rates across a region, releasing water from their
                    leaves in anticipation of seasonal rains to trigger the wet season early. Because of this,
                    seasonal rainfall in the Amazon begins 2 to 3 months earlier than the climate would otherwise
                    allow. Deforestation in the Amazon and anthropogenic climate change hold the potential
                    to interfere with this process, causing the forest to pass a threshold where it transitions into
                    savanna.

                <p>Africa’s forests and woodlands can be classified into nine general categories including tropical
                    rain forests, tropical moist forests, tropical dry forests, tropical shrubs, tropical mountain
                    forest, subtropical humid forests, subtropical dry forests, subtropical mountain forests and
                    plantations. Mangrove forests cover 3390,107 ha. Only 32.5 million ha of forests and woodlands,
                    or five percent of the total forest area, are formally protected.

                    Africa has a high per capita forest cover at 0.8 ha per person compared to 0.6 ha globally.

                    On average, forests account for 6 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in Africa, which is
                    the highest in the world.

                    In Uganda, for example, forests and woodlands are now recognized as an important component of
                    the nation’s stock of economic assets and they contribute in excess of US$546.6 million to the
                    economy through forestry, tourism, agriculture and energy.

                    Forests and woodlands also contribute to the long-term social and economic development goals of
                    New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) and can play an important role in addressing
                    the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and meeting its targets. They provide energy, food,
                    timber and non-timber forest products (NTFPs) and are important contributors to wealth and
                    health at the household, community, national, sub-regional, regional or even global
                    level.Forests account for 75% of the gross primary productivity of the Earth's biosphere, and
                    contain 80% of the Earth's plant biomass.[7] biomass per unit area is high compared to other
                    vegetation communities. Much of this biomass occurs below ground in the root systems and as
                    partially decomposed plant detritus. The woody component of a forest contains lignin, which is
                    relatively slow to decompose compared with other organic materials such as cellulose or
                    carbohydrate. The world's forests contain about 606 gigatonnes of living biomass (above- and
                    below-ground) and 59 gigatonnes of dead wood. The total biomass has decreased slightly since
                    1990, but biomass per unit area has increased.[31]

                <p>When you think wild animals, you probably have visions of lions and tigers and bears.

                    Even a pugnacious chimp or monkey, swinging through the trees, or a gangster-tough honey badger,
                    crashing through the brush looking for bee hives.

                    They may be wild, but are they the wildest?

                    If we are comparing "wild" with "tame" there haven't been many concentrated attempts to tame
                    chimps or badgers.The beautiful zebra and the magnificent buffalo.

                    The wildest of all wild animals, buffalo and zebras have resisted all efforts to tame them. Even
                    buffalo cows kept in captivity refuse to be milked.

                    Seeing how widespread common domestic cattle and horses are, if they coulda been, they woulda
                    been, and sometimes you will see an individual who has given in to a saddle or cart, but as a
                    species they are wild to the bone.Wild animals have survived in their native habitat for the
                    entire existence of their species. They have never been selectively bred for the purposes of
                    human beings.

                    That being said, nearly every species of animal, reptile, even fish and insects, have been held
                    in captivity at one time or another.

                    The question is, how well do they take to that captivity, and have they been altered by it.

                    The tiger and the lion may be the first animals that comes to mind when we talk about a wild
                    animal, but there are generations of lions and tigers that have been bred in captivity not just
                    in zoos, where their wild behavior may be somewhat retained, but in circuses and in the pet
                    industry.

                    In these situations, it isn't the most powerful and fearsome male that reproduces, it is the
                    most amiable and tractable individuals, and occasionally, those with unique coat color.

                    Generations of big cats bred with tameness in mind has not made them pussycats, but in most
                    cases it has created individuals with calmer demeanors, and even significantly smaller fangs!
