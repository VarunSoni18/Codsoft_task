        <div class="stxt">I have been working on my these up mentioned skills since last year and Now I have a good grip
            on these skills. I am happy to say that these portfolio website is a result of my skills, I have developed.
            And there is some skills which i had like to mention:-
        <p>I had learn c and c++ language in 1st year of my college and currently start DSA with c++
            and If talk about my drawing its like a special part of my life i have doing this since I was a child. i also like to do research that,s why i,m good at it.
        </p>
        <p>As a front-end web developer I had create landing pages and some small projects till now and thier interface design is awesome 
            and I also know about Data Basemanagment as i had been using Microsoft Excel and MySQL for this btt i had to give it a try withh cloud computing.
        </p>
        <p>At last as going for problem solving and my soft skill, I just want to say that I think i can find the error in any c and c++ programm also in html,css and js easily
            and i think my soft skills is also good as i like to debate with people on a good topic and in a good way.
